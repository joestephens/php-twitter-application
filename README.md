# PHP Twitter Application
## About
We're looking to see how much you can learn within a short timeframe. Please do the main exercise, and if you have time then also try and tick off as many of the bonus points as you can.

I would advise that you make something basic that works to begin with, and then proceed to structure the application in terms of MVC (model-view-controller) and OOP (object-oriented programming).

Resources are provided below which should help to guide you. The use of a PHP Twitter wrapper is highly recommended to save you time.

Please develop on your localhost (look at MAMP below) and commit regularly to a Git repo. Push your finished or partial solution to GitHub.

## Specification
Please create a web application - using PHP and HTML - that fetches tweets from [Karma's Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/KarmacrewTV) and displays them on a webpage.

Bonus points:
* Allow the user of the application to choose whose Twitter feed they would like to view (a username text input with a PHP POST request for example).
* Store the retrieved tweets in a MySQL database and output the tweets from the database (this wouldn't be best practice in production but will demonstrate ability to store and retrieve from databases).
* Use JavaScript and AJAX to load/update content without refreshing the page.
* Basic styling with CSS.
